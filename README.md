# mediawiki-renamer
This application helps you rename MediaWiki articles automatically. Say you are contributing
to a wiki about a game called Clash of Candy Crusher Birds. There are articles about the 
Blue Bird, Red Bird and Yellow Bird. Now, Clash of Candy Crusher Birds 2 is released, and 
you need to disambiguate the pages, because the new game also has Blue, Red and Yellow Birds,
but with different properties. You then use this application to automatically append a string,
say, " (original)", into the names of all articles about the first game.
